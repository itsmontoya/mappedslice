`mappedslice` is a Go library for efficient, memory map-backed slices. It provides a way to work with large datasets by mapping files directly into memory, allowing for fast and efficient access and manipulation of data. Ideal for applications needing high-performance data handling without loading entire files into RAM.

## Features:
- Memory-mapped slices for efficient file access
- Supports large datasets with minimal memory overhead
- Easy-to-use API for integrating with existing Go applications
